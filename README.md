# Pizza Project
Team 2: Marius, Rickard, Bj√∂rn, Abdel

## Rules
__NEVER__ commit to main. These are the different branches:
* The __MAIN__ branch is only for finished releases.
* The __DEV__ branch is for finished features, but not releases.
* The __FEATURE/[feature_name]__ is for each indidual feature listed in the scrum backlog. For every feature we will have a seperate branch, named accordingly: __feature/[feature-name]__, for example feature/pizza_menu.
